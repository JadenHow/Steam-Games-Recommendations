# Steam-Games-Recommendations
# INSTRUCTION: Make sure that the steam.csv file is in the right location. It should be in a
# folder named 'datasets'. read.py, compute.py, display.py, main.py, and datasets folder should
# be in the same folder. When inserting your games, you should refer to the game name on steam.
# Capital letters and symbols matter when you are inputting the game name. For example:
# 'Counter-Strike' should not be spelled 'counter-strike', 'counter - strike', or 'Counter-strike'.
# The similarity score is calculated based on your preference, whether it be the category, genre,
# tag, or developer of the game. It can be one or even all! When the question asks for the number
# of games or maximum price, please input the number but not the spelling of the number. Our
# rating score of the game is calculated by the number of positive ratings over the sum of the
# number of positive ratings and the number of negative ratings multiply by 100. There is also an
# option for you to input the minimum rating score for your recommended games.
# It can be from 0 to 100. That is all there is for the instruction. Have fun using it!
